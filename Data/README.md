Data coming from the CDISC Pilot Study can be found under the CDISC Pilot Study folder as well as at the CDISC website. 

While all data sets are provided to help with executing the programs, the data sets that are created by the authors are not necessarily following standard CDISC ADaM data set naming conventions. Typically, these data sets would be temporary data sets created at time of graph creation.  They are saved as permanent data sets to facilitate the execution of the programs that are found in the book.

		Data for Chapter 2 are found under CDISC Pilot Study/adam sub-folder and ADaM sub-folder.
		Data for Chapters 3, 6, 8 and 9 are found under ADaM sub-folder.
		Data for Chapter 4 are found under TFLDAT sub-folder.
		Data for Chapters 5 and 7 are found under TFLDAT sub-folder

Details for data sets needed for each chapter are specified in the README files under Program/Chapter #.
