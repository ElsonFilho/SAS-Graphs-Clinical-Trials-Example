In order to view the HTML files as webpages, you need to open GitHub Desktop version and open the repository in Explorer (Ctrl+Shift+F within GitHub Desktop). From within Explorer you can select 
		"aes.html" to see how the interactive graphs works (Section 7.2.1)
		"aes_ALL_SEVERITIES.html" to see how the drop-down selection menu works (Section 7.2.1.3)
